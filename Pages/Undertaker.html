            Mark William Calaway (born March 24, 1965), better known by the ring name The Undertaker, is an American retired professional wrestler. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time,[11] Calaway spent the vast majority of his career wrestling for WWF/E, and is best known for his critically acclaimed "Deadman" Undertaker gimmick, for which he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2022.[12] Calaway remains employed for WWE through a 15-year contract signed in 2019.

            Calaway began his career in 1987, working under various gimmicks for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) and other affiliate promotions. He became USWA Unified World Heavyweight Champion and WCWA Texas Heavyweight Champion during this time. After signing with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1989, he had a brief stint in the mid-card as "Mean" Mark Callous, before joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, turned WWE) in 1990.

            Calaway was rebranded as "The Undertaker" once joining the WWF. As one of WWE's most high-profile and enduring characters,[14][15] The Undertaker is famed for his undead, funereal, macabre "Deadman" persona, which gained significant mainstream popularity and won him the Wrestling Observer Newsletter award for Best Gimmick a record-setting 5 years in a row.[16] The longest-tenured wrestler in company history at 30 years, The Undertaker is also one of the most prominent figures of the Attitude Eraâ€“a high ratings, envelope-pushing generation of the WWF/E in the latter 1990s/early 2000s.[17] In 2000, Calaway expanded on The Undertaker, fleshing out the gimmick with a human side, biker identity, dubbed "The American Badass". Calaway later resurrected Deadman Undertaker in 2004, with residual elements of American Badass Undertaker remaining.
