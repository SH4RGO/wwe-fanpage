        <h1>Vince McMahon</h1>
        <p>
            Vincent Kennedy McMahon born August 24, 1945 is an American businessman, media proprietor and professional wrestling executive. He is the executive chairman of WWE, the world's largest professional wrestling company, having previously served as its chairman, CEO and controlling shareholder for 40 years. He is also the founder and owner of Alpha Entertainment, which he established in 2017 to oversee the 2020 revival of the XFL American football league.

            McMahon graduated from East Carolina University with a degree in business in 1968, and began his tenure in professional wrestling as a commentator for WWE (then called the World Wide Wrestling Federation or WWWF) for most of the 1970s; he bought the company from his father, Vincent J. McMahon, in 1982 and almost monopolized the industry, which previously operated as separate entities across the United States. This led to the development of the annual event WrestleMania, which became one of the world's most successful professional wrestling events. WWE then faced industry competition from World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the 1990s before purchasing and absorbing WCW in 2001. WWE also purchased the assets of the defunct Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 2003.

            McMahon has embarked on a number of WWE-related ventures. In 2014, he launched the WWE Network, a subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service. He also owns other WWE multimedia subsidiaries and a professional wrestling training facility. Outside of wrestling, he joint-owned and operated the XFL American football league twice; both the 2001 and 2020 iterations folded after a single season. He also headed the short-lived World Bodybuilding Federation and co-owns the clothing brand Tapout.

            McMahon has appeared on-screen for WWE since 1969, initially as a personable play-by-play commentator. In 1997, he adopted the character of Mr. McMahon, portrayed as an irascible, villainous, swaggering tyrant who obsessed over maintaining control of his wrestling company and often growled the catchphrase "you're fired!" when dismissing an employee.[3] Under the Mr. McMahon gimmick, which is considered by some to be WWE's greatest villainous character, he competed in wrestling matches and became a one-time WWE Champion, a one-time ECW Champion, a Royal Rumble winner, and a multi-time pay-per-view headliner.
